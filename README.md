# text-disguiser
Program to disguise writing styles in text for strenuous anonymity.

Inspiration: Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to be completely anonymous, which they nearly succeded at, but people analyzed their writing style and found that they are likely from a british upbringing (due to british grammar/phrases that were frequently used by the genius). They also were able to deduce that Satoshi likely had a lot of experience in academia publishing journals/papers due to them following a very consistent formatting style of their text (one example is they almost always used two spaces after every sentence). From their obsessive scrutiny of someone who clearly tried very hard to remain anonymous for their safety or for their projects prosperity, they have managed to build a very large and robust profile on this person. Non-malicious anonymitiy IS a human right, and any attempt at deconstructing this right is frankly disgusting and horrific.

Primary goals of the project:
- Create a program that can easily disguise your text style to prevent snoopy people online from identifying you.
- Be able to save, load, and randomly create writing styles that can be used to modify user's text.

Long-term goals:
- Be able to identify local phrases, words, or grammar and properly mask them to either other areas or use a more general style with similiar meaning ( I believe this will be quite difficult, if it can't be done to this extent, inform the user of this possible privacy risk so that they can change it themselves).
